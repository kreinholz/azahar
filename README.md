# FreeBSD port of Azahar - Nintendo 3DS emulator

This is an unofficial FreeBSD port of Azahar, the successor project to Citra (https://azahar-emu.org/).

With the emulators/citra and emulators/citra-qt5 ports set to be removed from the FreeBSD Ports collection on 31 October 2025, I thought it prudent to prepare a new port of Azahar, where development of the Citra codebase has continued following that project's demise.

To build on FreeBSD:

Clone this repository:

git clone git@github.com:kreinholz/azahar.git

cd azahar

sudo make install clean

(Alternatively, run 'make install clean' as root)
